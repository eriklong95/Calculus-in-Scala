1) Multiplication of polynomials
- define two polynomials f and g.
- print them.
- compute f * g and print the result.

2) Estimating sqrt(2)
- initialise Polynomial object representing x^2 - 2.
- estimate sqrt(2) using Polynomial.newtonsMethod with initialGuess = 1 and iterations = 2.
- repeat with initialGuess = 1 and iterations = 4.
- repeat with initialGuess = 10 and iterations = 4.
- repeat with initialGuess = -1 and iterations = 4.

3) Estimating Pi
- Gradient descent on cos with initialGuess = 3, iterations = 3, 5, 10, 100, alpha = 0.5.
- repeat with alpha = 0.1
- repeat with alpha = 0.9
- Compute Gaussian integral.
